# Ethereum and its Disruption of Blockchain Technology

## Overview and Origin


Ethereum's story begins in 2015 as a nonprofit cryptocurrency born as a reflection of Bitcoin. Ethereum was never incorporated due to being a non profit organization. The original founders are Mihai Alisie, Amir, Chetrit, Jeffrey Wilcke, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di lorio and Joseph Lubina, but were lead by Vitalik Buterin. The company was funded by ICO, 18 million in total, received in Bitcoin. The founder Vitalik Buterin was involved, studied and wrote blogs for Bitcoin Magazine early in the development of Bitcoin. After being inspired by Bitcoin, Vitalik wanted to create his own cryptocurrency focusing not only one peer to peer transactions, but also programmable apps on top of its blockchain. In 2013 Vitalik released his white paper for his idea of Ethereum and was announced in the first quarter of 2014 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. By the end of that year Vitalik had raised over 18 million and gained some cofounders to help him make Ethereum into what it is today. Ethereum’s first stage, known as “Frontier”, was released July 30, 2015 with the basic functions that enable users to mine ether and run smart contracts. The second stage, named “Homestead” was implemented after a substantial DAO hack occurred while trying to receive crowd source funds. This homestead stage was referred to as a safer form of Ethereum to prevent attacks like this in the future. The “Metropolis” stage came next, with a major focus on security, privacy and scalability. This stage of Ethereum required a lot of energy and attention to detail so they released it two separate parts. The first part was named “Byzantium” introduced Ethereum Improvement Protocols (EIP) which included other essential features. The second part of Metropolis was called “Constantinople”. This parts intention was to guide the installation of Byzantium and lay the foundation of switching Ethereum to proof-of-stake technology which will overall reduce the level of energy consumption.  We are now in what is called the “Serenity” phase also know as Ethereum 2.0. The goals of this stage are to become more scalable, secure and ultimately sustainable. With the growth of Ethereum the network has been jammed up with transactions which slows the overall speed and increases the “gas” fee for consumers. Ethereum 2.0 aims to fix these issues. 






## Business Activities

Ethereum’s goal is to become the most dominant L1 (layer 1) blockchain for both L2 (layer 2) integrations and everyday users alike. L1 blockchains are the essential piece to any cryptocurrency asset. They are the blockchain which all other L2 or “dApp” integrations need for usage. Examples of L1’s are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Luna. Examples of L2’s are Polygon, Polkadot and Loopring. When Ethereum was being developed they wanted to be the top L1 blockchain for other L2’s to build off of. L2’s or dApps can be used for many things, such as investing, gaming, arts / collectables and technology. Ethereum also aims to be the most widely used cryptocurrency for day to day transactions in everyday people providing an honest peer to peer network with many other use cases. The companies intended users are for L2 blockchain companies looking for a L1 to integrate with and everyday people looking to invest / grow / spend their money. With Ethereum being one of the first to the cryptocurrency landscape, they were able to offer the up and coming L2 protocols a very good L1 integration option. Having these L2 integrations only provides more value because uses the Ethereum blockchain and proves to new L2s that this is a proved way it can be done. 




## Landscape

Although cryptocurrency and blockchain is the major domain Ethereum is associated with, their integrations make them a player in multiple other facets as well. From Ethereum's website they mention investment, gaming, finance and even banking. Ethereum is widely known for their blockchain use but they also were leaders in proof of stake (PoS) and proof of work (PoW) technologies as well and continue to disrupt the industry. Other competitors in this domain would be Bitcoin, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Litecoin, Avalanche and Elrond. But you could also consider some L2 companies to be competition as well. Some of these are Polkadot, Enjin and Loopring.




## Results

The business impact of Ethereum has been substantial. Not only are they in competition with the world's leading L1 blockchain, Bitcoin, but these also have created a network of many L2 companies which are wildly successful today. By providing a network to branch off of many major companies need Ethereum to stay afloat. The core metrics used to measure success of cryptocurrencies are the following; Price, Market Cap, Total Transactions: and Volume. Ethereum is one of the top five cryptocurrencies in the space and considered the best when it comes to the multiple use cases. 







## Recommendations

One of the major problems Ethereum faces at the moment is the transaction speeds and costs. If they can figure out how to cut down on GAS fees and speed up transactions then they will be considered to go-to cryptocurrency for everyday transactions. Part of their problem is their own success. By having so many transactions on their network it has become jammed, which makes the speeds of transactions slower and prices higher. Many of the competitors offer faster transaction speeds and lower costs but do not have near the amount of transactions to compare. With Ethereum already being one of the “top dogs” for crypto in the forms of peer to peer interaction, if they can expand their network and solve this consumer issue Ethereum would ultimately secure its place as the top user friendly cryptocurrency. Ethereum is currently switching their network from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS). The point of this move is to relieve to stress of the network and ultimately reduce GAS fees and and increase transaction speeds. I believe Ethereum is on the correct track with this move due to the success of other cryptocurrencies using proof of stake technologies.
